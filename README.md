## Summary

Business-class network to improve and learn new skills. ISP Modem/Router is in bridge mode,

## Pain Points

- Building is solid concrete, even walls. No hardwired connections are possible, except to the main router.
- Single router offers adequate coverage for one floor, but minimal to no coverage for the other 3 as well as outside.
- Very limited budget, and will have to use existing hardware.
- Most afforable Ubiquiti equipment was out of stock, and local used market was sparse.
- Installation must be as unobtrusive as possible

## Areas to improve

- Wired backhaul to each AP would improve performance
- Omada controller only supports the APs. Router and Switch need to be configured independantly.
- APs are previous-generation (WiFi 5/AC), and will need to be upgraded later.
